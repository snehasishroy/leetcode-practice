1. Calculate sum of odd numbers between 1 and 1000 using stream

2.
interface Up {
    double take(); //may fail with OOM if not read for some time
}
interface Down {
    void push(double d); //may be slow
}
static Up up = ..;
static Down down = ...;
//you have to put only latest update from UP stream to DOWN stream

volatile double latestPrice = Double.NAN
main() {
    Thread producer = () -> {
        while (true) {
            latestPrice = up.take();
        }
    }
    Thread consumer = () -> {
        while (true) {
            down.push(latestPrice);
        }
    }
    producer.start();
    consumer.start();
}
Was asked to avoid infinite loop in consumer as it will overwhelm consumer. Consumer needs to be notified only if there is some new data.
Sounds similar to a producer consumer problem, where consumer is interested only in the latest value.
Was not able to recall how to issue an interrupt to consumer when new data is available.
